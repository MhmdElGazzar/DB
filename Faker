The Java Locale class object represents a specific geographic, cultural, or political region. 
It is a mechanism to for identifying objects, not a container for the objects themselves. 
A Locale object logically consists of the fields like languages, script, country, variant, extensions.
   Locale locale = Locale.GERMAN;
        for (String country : Locale.getISOCountries(Locale.IsoCountryCode.PART1_ALPHA2))
        {
            System.out.println(new Locale("", country).getDisplayCountry(locale));

        }
