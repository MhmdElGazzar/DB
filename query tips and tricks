2) if u are doing a query that will delete large number of customers 1000+ 
if the number is big > connection will timeout in deletion 
1- delete from schemaName.employee  where managerId  IN (1959, 1645) And  ROWNUM <= 1000 ;
2- delete from schemaName.employee  where empId  IN ( SELECT empId from schemaName.employee  where managerId =  1956 FETCH FIRST 1000 ROWS ONLY) ;
plus for loop 
BEGIN  
  FOR k IN 1..36 LOOP  
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(k);  
  END LOOP;  
END;  
commit;
